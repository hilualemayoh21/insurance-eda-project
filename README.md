# 📊 AlphaCare Insurance EDA Project

This project is part of a data analytics challenge for **AlphaCare Insurance Solutions (ACIS)**, a car insurance company in South Africa. The goal is to analyze historical insurance claims data to optimize marketing strategies and identify low-risk clients who can benefit from reduced premiums.

## 🎯 Project Objective

- Explore insurance claims data to understand client risk profiles.
- Conduct statistical analysis to test hypotheses related to risk and profitability.
- Identify patterns by geography, gender, and vehicle features.
- Build predictive models for claim amounts and premium optimization.
- Deliver actionable insights to help ACIS improve customer targeting and pricing strategy.
